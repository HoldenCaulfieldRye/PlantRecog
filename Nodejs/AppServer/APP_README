Testing

1. An instance of mongodb needs to be running on the server, at the right port.

	This is done as follows:
	
	```
	mongodb --port 55513 --dbpath /home/simon/group-project-master/AppServer &
	```
	
2. We are using a database called apptest, this is the db that the app will connect to.

	If we want to get a mongo client up and connect we do:
	
	```
	mongo --host plantrecogniser.no-ip.biz --port 55513
	```
	
	Then once we are within the mongo client, we switch to our database
	
	```
	use apptest
	```
	
	We can view the current entries with:
	
	```
	 db.usercollection.find().pretty()
	```
	
3. To start the server we install pre-requisites that are described in package.json

	```
	npm install
	```
	
4. Then we can launch the server with:

	```
	node app.js
	```
	
5. We should then be able to communicate with the app by doing

	```
	node testUpload.js
	```
	
	from either a local or remote machine
