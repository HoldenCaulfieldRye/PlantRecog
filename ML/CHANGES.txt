Unreleased
==========

- In ccn-predict, No longer require the last layer to be called
  'logprob'.  (This can also be a 'sqdiff' or whatever.)

- Add ccn-make-batches command that creates batches given a directory
  with one folder per image class.

- Add 'always-save' option to 'ccn-train' script.  This will save the
  latest checkpoint regardless of whether there was an improvement
  with the test score or not.
