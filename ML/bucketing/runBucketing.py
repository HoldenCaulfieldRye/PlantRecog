	This script generates a taxon tree and bucketing algo based on the logic 
	in 'tree.py'. 
	It then calls a function (insertBucketsIntoMongo) which will parse the 
	resulting algo and insert its contents into a MongoDB collection 

	This scripts expects 3 arguments: mongodb host; mongodb port; mongodb database
	TO-DO: Have the command line arguments parsed from a config file

	example usage: python runBucketing.py localhost 55517 development
